# Task 6 – Data Visualization Using Python

## Internship
Elevate Labs – Data Analyst Internship

## Objective
The objective of this task is to visualize data using Python charts to identify
patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

## Dataset Used
Medical Insurance Cost Dataset (cleaned_insurance.csv)

## Tools & Libraries
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Visualizations Created
- Bar chart: Average insurance charges by smoking status
- Line chart: Insurance charges vs age
- Histogram: Distribution of insurance charges
- Scatter plot: BMI vs insurance charges

## Insights
- Smokers have significantly higher insurance charges than non-smokers
- Insurance charges generally increase with age
- Insurance charges show a right-skewed distribution
- Higher BMI is associated with higher insurance charges

## Outcome
This task strengthened practical skills in data visualization and interpretation
using Python and Matplotlib.
