# Task 10: Python EDA – Summary & Outlier Detection

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Outlier Detection using Python as part of Data Analyst Internship Task 10.

## 📊 Dataset
**Students Performance in Exams**  
Source: Kaggle  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and checked shape, info, and head.
2. Generated descriptive statistics.
3. Checked missing values percentage.
4. Visualized distributions using histogram and boxplot.
5. Detected outliers using IQR method.
6. Created outlier flag column.
7. Retained outliers as they represent valid student performance.
8. Generated correlation matrix and interpreted results.
9. Exported cleaned dataset.

## 📈 Key Insights
- No missing values found.
- Strong positive correlation between reading and writing scores.
- Outliers represent genuine high/low performing students.

## 📁 Files Included
- `task10_eda.ipynb` – EDA notebook
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` – cleaned dataset
- `eda_findings.txt` – summary of findings

## ✅ Outcome
Practical understanding of EDA, visualization, outlier detection, and correlation ana
